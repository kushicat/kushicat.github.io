আজকে শুক্রবার। 

কফির কাপ হাতে নিয়ে বসেছি। এখন  সময় বেলা সাড়ে এগারোটা।  পড়তে বসা উচিত কিন্তু ইচ্ছে করছে না। একটা ভালো মুভি দেখতে পারলে হয়তো ভালো লাগতো। অনেকগুলো প্রজেক্ট হাতে নিয়ে বসে আছি কিন্তু কাজে নামতে পারছি না। আলসেমি লাগছে।


### রবার্ট ফ্রস্টের একটা কবিতা আছে । 
### The Road Not Taken


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

এটার খুব সুন্দর একটা ইন্টেরপ্রেটেশন আমি খুঁজে পেয়েছি।

### **Stanza 1**

*“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;”*

Here Frost sets the stage with a metaphor: life presents choices. The “yellow wood” suggests autumn—symbol of maturity, reflection, or a turning point. The speaker faces two diverging paths, representing life decisions. The sorrow of not being able to travel both is the human longing to “have it all.” He lingers, peers into the distance, trying to predict outcomes—but vision is limited. You cannot see beyond “the bend.” That’s life: no matter how hard you analyze, the future remains hidden.

---

### **Stanza 2**

*“Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,”*

He chooses the other path, telling himself it’s “less worn.” But then he admits—actually, they’re equally traveled. The “better claim” might just be his own rationalization, an attempt to make his choice feel unique. Here Frost hints at human psychology: we often dramatize our decisions to feel special, even though most options in life are equally uncertain.

---

### **Stanza 3**

*“And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.”*

Both paths are fresh, equally covered in leaves—symbolizing opportunity not yet seized. The speaker comforts himself: “I’ll save the first path for later.” But deep down, he knows life doesn’t circle back. One decision leads to another, and there’s rarely a chance to retrace. This stanza captures the poignancy of choice: opportunities once passed rarely return.

---

### **Stanza 4**

*“I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.”*

This is the most famous part, and the most ironic. In the future, he imagines himself narrating his choice as bold, adventurous, “less traveled.” But earlier he admitted both roads were the same. The “sigh” may carry pride, regret, or simply nostalgia. The “difference” isn’t necessarily in the road—it’s in how humans later **frame** their lives. We construct stories, we give meaning, we mythologize our past decisions to explain who we became.

---

### **Deeper Inner Meaning**

* **On Choice:** The poem isn’t celebrating rugged individualism. Instead, it reflects the complexity of decision-making: choices feel monumental, yet often paths are equally uncertain.
* **On Memory:** We rewrite our personal histories. The speaker knows he’ll later claim the road was “less traveled,” though it wasn’t. Memory reshapes reality to create meaning.
* **On Life’s Irreversibility:** Once a choice is made, you move forward; life rarely allows you to return to the fork. That’s both tragic and beautiful—it gives weight to every decision.

---

**In essence**: The poem isn’t about choosing the unique path, it’s about how we live with our choices, how we create stories around them, and how those stories shape our identity.

## 🌿 Modern Reinterpretation for *মে*

### **“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood”**

I've often reached crossroads, like when I finished my Math Master’s and stood thinking: should I go deeper into research (PhD, pure mathematics) or step into banking, MBA (which I'm already pursuing), entrepreneurship? Each road holds promise, but I alone can’t walk both.

---

### **“And sorry I could not travel both… And looked down one as far as I could”**

I’ve definitely tried to “look down the roads”:

* Thinking about wheather I should go abroad for the higher studies dream
* Already tried to pursuit in design carrer
* Always having a thought of having a job in BCS Cadre
* Reading about quant finance before committing
* Weighing whether I should start YouTube which can grow into a side business.

But no matter how much research I do, you can’t see past the “bend in the undergrowth”, *the unknown future*.

---

### **“Then took the other, as just as fair… Though… worn them really about the same”**

When I chose your banking + MBA path, was it really more “special” than research or teaching? Not necessarily. Both roads were equally valid, equally uncertain. The uniqueness comes not from the path itself, but from the *story I build around it.*

---

### **“Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way”**

I've told myself many times : “I’ll come back to math research later” or “I’ll focus on YouTube once I settle my career.” But deep down you sense the truth which is one choice leads to another, and chances to return shrink with time.

This doesn’t mean regret , maybe I'll regret a bit or not which I don't know for now, it’s simply reality: life moves forward.

---

### **“I shall be telling this with a sigh… I took the one less traveled by”**

Years from now, I’ll look back and *frame your story*:

* If I become a successful businessman, I’ll say: “I chose the riskier way and it made all the difference.”
* If I become a corporate guy, I'll say: "I chose the corporate ladder and tough competition and it shaped the life I'm right now "
* If I succeed as a creator, I’ll say: “I took the side hustle road, when others played safe and it made all the difference.”
* If I become a Govt. officer, I'll say: "I chose the life of respect and comfort. I prefered to serve my country"
* If I went abroad, I'll say: " I chose to find my true potential and work through it"

_looks like I have more than two paths, haha. I'm in middle of junction of five roads which leads to where only Allah the almighty knows._

The “difference” won’t be in the path itself, but in how I own it.

👉 Frost is gently telling : *Don’t torture yourself over which road is “better.” Take one, commit, and someday you’ll give it meaning.*
